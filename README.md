# tadpoleAdEx

## Overview
Integrate-and-fire model of the Xenopus tadpole spinal cord. Uses physiological recordings and simulation-based inference to optimise parameters. Simple biophysical model to display output of the spinal cord activity.

## Motivation
So far only a Hodgkin-Huxley model of the tadpole spinal cord exists. This integrate-and-fire model has fewer parameters and so is amenable to development.

## Methods
- Python
- Simulation-based Inference (SBI)

## Results
Outputs are alternating descending waves of activity down both sides of the spinal cord. The biophysical model shows undulatory swimming activity.

## How to Run
1. Clone repo
2. Install requirements
3. Run script
